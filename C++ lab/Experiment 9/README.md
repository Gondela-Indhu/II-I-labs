Program to demonstrate Constructors & Destructors


Step-by-step process of the experiment:

1.A constructor which does not receive any parameters is called a Default Constructor, or a ‘Zero Argument Constructor’.

2.A Parameterized Constructor, which is a constructor that can accept one or more arguments. This helps programmers to assign varied initial values to an object at the time of

creation.

3.Copy constructor is a type of constructor which is used to create a copy of an already existing object of a class type.

4.Destructor is invoked when the instance is destroyed
