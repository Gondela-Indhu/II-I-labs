Write a C++ program to use scope resolution operator. Display the various values of the same variables declared at different scope levels.

Step-by-step process by the experiment:
1.When both global and local variables have the same name then global variable in hidden inside the local scope. Here,using the scope resolution operator to refer to the global variable.
2.When a class has a function prototype inside but the definition is outside of the class. Here, to define the function outside the class we use the scope resolution operator.
3.The scope resolution operator can be used to access static members of a class when there is a local variable with the same name.
