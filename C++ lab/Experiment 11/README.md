Write a C++ program to create multilevel inheritance.

Step-by-step process of the Experiment:

1.Create a base class named base and declare a instance variable (a).

2.Create a base construtor and initialize the instance variable in it.

3.Now,create a derived class derived1 and inherit the properties from the class base.

4.Again,create a new derived class derived2 and interit properties of the class derived1.

5.In the Multilevel inheritance, the child class derives from a class which already derived from another class.

6.Here, the derived2 class has derived from derived1 class which was already derived from base Class
