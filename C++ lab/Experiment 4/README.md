Write a C++ program to declare Struct. Initialize and display contents of member Variables.

Step-by-step process for the algorithm:
1.Include the required header files (iostream.h).
2.Create a structure (student) with the following member variables.
Name, roll_no, branch, and grade as data members.
3.Create a main() method.
4.Create a variable of the above structure inside the main() method.
5.Then, read data into member variables of that structure using structure variable with dot operator.
6.Finally, display data of member variables of that structure using structure variable with dot operator
