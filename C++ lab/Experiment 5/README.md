Write a C++ program to declare a class. Declare pointer to class. Initialize and display the contents of the class member.

Step-by-step process of the Experiment:

1.Include the required header files (iostream.h, string).

2.Create a class (employee) with the following members as public members. Name, ID, Salary as data members. void read() ,void display() as member functions.

3.Create a main() method.

4.Create a variable (s1) and a pointer variable (ptr) of the above class inside the main() method.

5.Assign the address of class object (s1) to class pointer object (ptr).

6.Then, call the member functions void read() ,void display() using class pointer object (ptr) to illustrate member functions access using class pointer.

7.Assign values to data members of the class using class pointer object to illustrate data members access using class pointer.

8.Finally, call the member functions void read() ,void display() using class pointer object (ptr).
