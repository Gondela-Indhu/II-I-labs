name, id, basic, DA, IT, net_salary, as data memebrs.
void read() and void display() as member functions.
3.Create a main() method.
4.Create an array of class object with (E1) a specific size and i as integer.
5.Read i.
6.Call the read() method through the array of class object from 0 to i.
7.Call the display() method through the array of class object from 0 to i.
